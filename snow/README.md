## Snowfall Animation
This Python program creates a simple snowfall animation in the terminal using ASCII characters. It generates a grid and simulates falling snowflakes.

## Setup and Usage

# Requirements:
Python 3.x installed on your system.

# Installation and Running the Program:
Download the snowfall.py file.
Run the script using Python: python snowfall.py in your terminal or command prompt.

## Configuration
SNOW_DENSITY: Adjust the density of snowflakes on the screen by changing this value (in percentage).
DELAY: Set the time delay for the animation in seconds.

## Usage Notes
The program uses ASCII characters to simulate snowflakes.
Snowflakes fall randomly across the terminal screen.
The animation loops indefinitely until manually stopped (by interrupting the program).

## Compatibility
The program uses Python's os, time, and random modules and is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.

## Controls
No specific controls are required as the animation runs automatically upon execution.
