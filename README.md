# Recipe Finder

This Python program utilizes the Edamam API to find recipes based on ingredients, dietary requirements, and meal preferences. It prompts the user to input ingredients, dietary needs, and meal type and retrieves recipes accordingly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

## API Keys

You need to provide your own API credentials for the Edamam API. Obtain your `app_id` and `app_key` from the [Edamam website](https://developer.edamam.com/).

Replace the placeholders in the script with your credentials:

```python
app_id = "YOUR_APP_ID_HERE"
app_key = "YOUR_APP_KEY_HERE"
